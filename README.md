# Marine Mammal Laboratory UAS Engineering Repository

## What is this about?
The Marine Mammal Laboratory (MML) employs a variety of commercially available uncrewed aerial systems (UAS) to support scientific studies of species within our purview. These platforms allow for collection of data in areas that are otherwise too difficult or dangerous to survey with other platforms such as crewed aircraft or vessels.

As we often use these UAS in ways that the manufacture may not have considered during their initial design, it is sometimes necessary to augment the capabilities of the UAS to support our operations. For example, deploying and recovering a UAS from a small boat requires certain hardware that commercially available drones may not have. 

Towards these challenges, MML staff have developed various solutions to maximize the utility of our platforms. We established this github repository to help disseminate these designs amongst the NOAA UAS user community, and to foster engineering collaboration and problem solving.

## How are parts organized?
We organize parts by platform, then by function (e.g. DJI M30T; hand launch and recovery).

## How can I contribute?
Feedback and raising issues on the design of parts will be helpful for improving the design of various parts. Please use the github "issues" functionality to do so.
