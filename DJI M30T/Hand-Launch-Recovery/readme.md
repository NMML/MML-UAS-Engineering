The rear rotors on the DJI M30T are downward facing (i.e. in a pushing configuration) and in close proximity to the belly of the drone. This configuration makes hand launch and recovery (HLR) dangerous as there is little to no separation between the rotor and the catcherâ€™s hands. To address this, we developed an assembly that provides a handhold that provides sufficient separation from the rotor to enable HLR.
Our design employs 3D printed parts to interface with the drone and makes liberal use of carbon fiber tube to reduce weight and 3D printing complexity.  The assembly is secured to the M30T with an elastic strap (see below). 

## Material Manifest
You will need the following materials
- 6x6 Carbon Fiber Square Tube
- 10mm Carbon Fiber Tube (10mm outer diameter, 8mm inner diameter)
- 18mm Carbon Fiber Tube (18mm outer diameter, 16mm inner diameter)

We utilized the following materials. Your mileage may vary based on your 3D printer and access to binding agents. Be advised, some glues/epoxy react with certain types of plastic, so double check to see if there are any interactions.
- Polylactic Acid Filament (PLA). We suggest "PLA Pro" or "PLA Plus". But really, any filament type will work. 
- JB Weld Epoxy 
- Voile Rack Strap (20")

## Tools Needed
- Saw (to cut CF tube)
- 3D Printer

## General instructions
1. Cut 6x6 CF Tube (2x 152mm, 2x 112mm)
2. Cut 10mm OD CF Tube. Cut to desired length, no less than 155mm (4x 155mm)
3. Cut 18mm OD CF Tube (2x 212mm)
4. Slide strap stopper onto 152mm CF square tube. You can't do this later, so do it now! This pieces should be 41mm from the aft "corner piece"
5. Slide aft shelf onto aft 112mm CF square tube. Same as above, do it now, but note the orientation! This piece should be centered on the aft 112mm tube.
6. Assemble the upper portion by inserting the square tubes into the "corner pieces." Use expoxy to secure these (suggest putting expoxy/glue in the square hole before inserting square tube)
7. Use epoxy to affix shelf/stopper to CF tube.
8. Assemble the lower portion. Its straightforward!
